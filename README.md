# hymnal_app

This app has 2 purposes:
1. Me learning project developement and new technology namely Flutter
2. Providing an app with songs that are used in christian communities (not finished)

## Implemented
- GUI is in nice shape but should be finished 
- Firestore Database is implemented but might be changed to something that allows full text query
- Algolia search engine implemented but is too expensive and probably will be removed 

## Not implemented
- Splash screen
- GUI for viewing a specific song
- switching between songs
- Database and search engine that are affordable

There is a private repository with angular web app where one can add songs to the database
